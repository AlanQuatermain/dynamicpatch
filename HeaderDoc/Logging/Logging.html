<H1>Logging Utilities</H1><hr>
The DynamicPatch framework's integrated logging interface.

<br>
<p></p>
<b>Includes:</b> <!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/doc/header/DPAPI.h" -->"DPAPI.h"<!-- /a -->,
<!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/doc/header/stdarg.h" -->&lt;stdarg.h&gt;<!-- /a --><br>
<p></p>
<hr><br>
There are four main classes of logging: Debug, Messages, Errors,
and Emergencies. Appended to this is the ability to write to a log with
a given name.
<br><br>
NB: By default, this API works as described below. However, there
is a preprocessor flag which will make it use the syslog
functions instead.
<br><br>
Each log type conditionally writes to one or more files. In addition, 
the Emergency log routines may optionally put up a general alert dialog.
This behaviour is user-modifiable.
<br><br>
Each of the four main log operations will write to a logfile whose name
takes the format '[name].log', where [name] is the value provided to the
<!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/c/func/InitLogs" -->InitLogs <!-- /a --> function. In addition, the Error and
Emergency log operations will write the same data, along with the 
specified name, to a file called 'errors.log'.
<br><br>
All logfiles will be automatically rolled when they reach 2Mb in size.
There will be a maximum of five logfiles (named xxx.log, xxx.log.1, etc.)
for each filename in existence at any one time. As such, each application
can potentially use up to 10Mb of disk space for logs. However, a cron
job (such as that used on /var/log) can easily clean up or compress old
files, if required.
<br><br>
The Debug log will not print information to any logfile by default. To
enable output from the DebugLog function, the end user must create a
folder called 'Debug' within the log folder (currently
'/Library/Logs/DynamicPatch'). Similarly, the Emergency log will not put
up user alerts by default, but can be enabled by creating a folder
called 'Notify' within the same log folder.
<br><br>
In addition to printing information to these logfiles,  LogEmergency will
write to the syslog using the LOG_CRIT priority. Emergency-level logs are
generally not expected to happen, and should only be use in dire need.
<br><br>
Since emergencies get filed to the system log as critical errors, messages
will appear in all command-line terminals in the event of an emergency, and
those terminal will in that case issue a beep.
<br><br>
For assistance in providing useful debugging information, it is recommended
that the debug log be accessed through the <!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/c/macro/DEBUGLOG" -->DEBUGLOG <!-- /a -->
macro. That macro will feed file/line information into the debug log, to
aid in tracking down errors. This is especially useful when dealing with
repetitive network communication handlers, where a general error message
of "Server returned error: -5006" doesn't help to locate the associated
code, but where it isn't desirable to type detailed location information
with slight differences a hundred times over.
<br><br>
A side benefit of these logging functions is access to an authoritative
application name, where that might be useful; for instance, in a loadable
bundle or framework. The <!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/c/func/ApplicationName" -->ApplicationName <!-- /a -->
function will store the application name in a static buffer on first
call, and will return the address of this buffer to the caller. In addition,
it is CFM-aware: if it detects a Unix application name of 'LaunchCFMApp', it
will dynamically bind to the Carbon framework, which by definition should 
already be loaded, and will use the CopyProcessName function to get the
real name of the application.
<br><br>
<b>Usage:</b><br />
Before calling any logging functions, call <!-- a logicalPath="//apple_ref/c/func/InitLogs" -->InitLogs <!-- /a -->,
passing the name of your application (or the desired name for your logfile,
if different). Until this call is made, no logging functions will work. 
<br><br>
After initialization, use the basic logging functions as you would printf,
and if necessary, you can use the va_list versions to perform part of the 
processing yourself, or to feed your own vararg logging routines through 
this API.
<br><br>
It is not necessary to manually close the logging system. It installs an 
exit handler to release any allocated resources. Currently, the only
action taken on exit is to close the system log, but this is potentially
subject to change.
